# Air-BnB-Price-Prediction

•	The aim of this project is to build a model that can predict the price of each property or house in different regions in U.S. based on the location, neighbourhood, different type of reviews, availability, city and previous prices, etc. 
•	We also aim to estimate the popularity of the property based on the given features.
•	The outcome of the project is that it will predict the price of the rooms efficiently as it will take into consideration various given factors and estimate an amount accordingly rather than randomly deciding the worth of a property.
